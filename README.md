# TCPU1.1 Emulator

An incomplete Rust emulator for my 8-bit SBC. This is the first program I've written in Rust. The original emulator was written in C. 

My brain thinks in C, so this is probably written a lot more C-like than it should be for a Rust program. But, it seems to pass all the safety checks apart from some debug functions.
